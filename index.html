            <h3><b>Hobbies</b></h3>
            <p> I am what you describe as a total nerd, and my hobbies revolve around that too. I love building and painting miniature figures, whenever I get stressed this is my go-to activity. To be exact, I love to build and play Warhammer 40k models. Besides modeling, I also love the outdoor! I love to go fishing, hiking, and traveling with my friends. However, these hobbies are very expensive, so working hard to secure the funds is one of my drives.</p>

            <h3><b>Career Goal</b></h3>
<p> MOORES LAW IS COMING TO A END!! If we look at the graph of a Moore's Law, stating thread doubles every year, which is true. However, the increase in the speed of the CPU has slowed down significantly in the past years. This is due to the internal temperature of the CPU gets overheated and the speed hits its limit. I feel like a wave of new architectural CPU is coming where everyone can get it. Google is indeed working on Quantum Computers, but the environment it runs in is way too difficult for anyone to own one at home. I want to be a part of this new wave, designing and making new CPUs. I wanted to become a CPU engineer and bring the new wave to everyone's home computer.</p>          </div>
